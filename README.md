Hi! My name is Alejandro Serrano and I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Utah. I'm currently in my senior year with expected graduation date of Spring 2023.
I began studying computer science because I love video games, but throughout the major I've also found a passion for Web Development. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal portfolio with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Unreal Engine 5.
