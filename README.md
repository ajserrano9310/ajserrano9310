### Hi there 👋

Hi! My name is Alejandro Serrano and I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Utah. I'm currently in my senior year with expected graduation date of Spring 2023.
I began studying computer science because I love video games, but throughout the major I've also found a passion for Web Development. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my personal portfolio with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Unreal Engine 5.
- 📫 If you want to reach me, you can shoot me an e-mail at ajserranosoria@gmail.com
